Run every N sessions. Checklist:

1. Verify BACKLOG.md items haven't been silently completed
2. Identify stale backlog entries
3. Flag overlapping backlog items
4. Identify complexity flags (large files, high useState count, etc.)
5. Verify @tags are up to date with recent commits
6. Verify project rules are followed (spot-check)
